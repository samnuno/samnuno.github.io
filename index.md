# Samuel Nuno's Portfolio

I am a freshman at CSUF this is currently my first semester and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120l labs

* Lab 2:
 I really enjoyed Lab 2 because it provided a solid foundation for the semester ahead. We covered important concepts and techniques that helped me understand the core principles I would need in upcoming labs and coursework. This early preparation boosted my confidence and allowed me to approach more complex tasks with a clearer understanding of the fundamentals.

* Lab 3:
 Lab 3 was a great continuation of Lab 2, where we delved deeper into more specific applications of the concepts we had previously learned. I particularly appreciated how this lab emphasized problem-solving and hands-on experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. This lab also challenged me to think critically and adapt to new challenges, which was both exciting and rewarding.

* Lab 6:
 Lab 6 was particularly enjoyable because it focused on vectors and how they are used in real-world applications. I found it fascinating to see how vector analysis plays a critical role in various fields such as engineering, physics, and computer graphics. The lab allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of vector operations and their practical significance, making the concepts much more relevant and engaging.
